\section{Cone}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Let $M_n$ be a sequence of $m$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds such that 
$\sec_{M_n}\ge -\eps_n$ for some sequence of positive real numbers $\eps_n\zz\to 0$.
Assume $M_n$ converges to the product space $\RR^{m-2}\times L$, where $L$ is a two-dimensional cone.
Then the cosectional curvature on $M_n$ converges weakely to ???.
\end{thm}
