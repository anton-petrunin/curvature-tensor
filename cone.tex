\section{Cone}

Let $M$ be a 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold.
Given a smooth function $f$ denote, denote by $L_c$ the level set of $f$;
that is,
\[L_c=\set{x\in M}{f(x)=c}.\]
If $L_c$ is a smooth surfaces in a neighborhood of $x\in L_c$,
then denote $k_1(x)\le k_2(x)$ the principle curvatures of $L_c$ at $x$
and set $G(x)=k_1(x)\cdot k_2(x)$.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Let $M_n$ be a sequence of $3$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds
and $f_n\: M_n\to \RR$ be a sequence of strongly concave functions.
Assume $M_n\to A$ and $f_n\to f\:A\to \RR$ as $n\to \infty$.
Suppose that $f$ is affine; that is $f$ is convex and concave at the same time.
Then $G_{f_n}$ weakly converges to zero.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Fix $x\in A$.
It is sufficient to show that for any $\eps>0$ there is 

It is sufficient to show that given $\eps>0$ and $p\in L_c\subset A$ there is $\delta>0$
