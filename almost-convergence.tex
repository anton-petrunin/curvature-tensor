\section{Convergence of functions}

Let $f$ be a continuous semiconcave function defined on an open subset of Alexandrov space $A$.
Given $p\in \Dom f$, set 
\begin{align*}
\mathfrak{a}_f(p)&=\limsup_{x\to p}\frac{f(x)-f(p)}{|x-p|},
&
\mathfrak{b}_f(p)&=\limsup_{x\to p}\frac{f(p)-f(x)}{|p-x|}.
\end{align*}
Note that $\mathfrak{a}_f(p)=|\nabla_pf|$.

Recall that a function $f$ defined on Alexandrov space is called differentable at $p\in \Dom f$ if its differential at $p$ is a linear function;
that is, $d_pf\:\T_p\to\RR$ is concave and convex at the same time.

\begin{thm}{Claim} Let $f$ be a continuous semiconcave function defined on an open subset of Alexandrov space $A$.
Then  $f$ is differentiable at $p\in\Dom f$ if and only if $\mathfrak{a}_f(p)=\mathfrak{b}_f(p)$.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:ab}
Let $A_n\to A$ be a convergence of Alexandrov spaces with uniform lower curvature bound
and $f_n$ be a sequence of continuous $\lambda$-concave functions defined on open domains in  $A_n$ that converges to a function $f$ defined on open domains in  $A$.

Then for any sequence of points $A_n\ni p_n\to p\in A$ we have
that 
\[\liminf_{n\to\infty}|\nabla_{p_n}f_n|\ge \mathfrak{a}_{f}(p)\]
and 
\[\limsup_{n\to\infty}|\nabla_{p_n}f_n|\le \mathfrak{b}_{f}(p)\]

In particular, if $f$ is differentiable at $p$, then 
\[\lim_{n\to\infty}|\nabla_{p_n}f_n|= |\nabla_{p}f|.\]
\end{thm}

Applying the coarea formula together with \ref{prop:ab}, we get the following:

\begin{thm}{Corollary}
Let $A_n\to A$ be a convergence of Alexandrov spaces with uniform lower curvature bound
and $f_n$ be a sequence of continuous $\lambda$-concave functions defined on open domains in  $A_n$ that converges to a function $f$ defined on open domains in  $A$.

Suppose that a sequence of nonnegative functions $\psi_n$ on $A_n$ weakly converge on every level sets of $f_n$ as $n\to \infty$. %has to be defined???
Let $\mu$ and $\nu$ be two weak partial limits of $\psi_n$ on $A$.
Then 
\[\mathfrak{a}_f\cdot \mu\le \mathfrak{b}_f\cdot \nu.\]
In particular, if $f$ is smooth and $\nabla f\ne 0$, then 
$\psi_n$ converges weakly to a measure on $A$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Smooth-convergence lemma}\label{lem:smooth-covergence}
Let $M_n$ be a sequence of Riemannian manifolds with a universal lower converges without collapse to an Alexandrov space $A$.
Suppose for a common charts $s$ for this convergence with domain $\Omega\subset\RR^m$ the induced metric from $A$ is smooth.

Assume that $f_n$ is a sequence of smooth $\lambda$-concave functions defined on the domain of $s_n$ that converges to a smooth function $f_\infty$ defined on the domain of $s_\infty$.
Then in this common chart $df_n$ pointwise converges to $df$ and
$\Hess f_n$ weakly converges to $\Hess f$.
More precisely, 
\begin{itemize}
\item if $X$ is a smooth vector field on $\Omega$, then 
\[df_n(ds_n(X))\to df(ds(X));\]
\item if $X$ and $Y$ is a smooth vector field on $\Omega$, then 
\[(\Hess f_n)(ds_n(X),ds_n(Y))\rightharpoonup\Hess f(ds(X),ds(Y)).\]
\end{itemize}
\end{thm}

\section{Rough convergence}
\label{sec:rough-convergence}

Assume $f$ is a semiconcave function defined on an open subset $\Dom f$ of Alexandrov space $A$.
For a point $p\in \Dom f$ set 
\[\delta_f(p)=\limsup_{x\to p}\{|\nabla_x f|-|\nabla_p f|\}.\]
The value $\delta_f(p)$ should be considered as a measure of nonsmoothness of the function $f$ at $p$.
Namely we say that a function $f$ is \emph{differentiabale} at $p\in\Dom f$
if $d_pf$ is a linear function of $\T_p$, that is, $d_pf$ is concave and convex at the same time.
In this case %???ref
\[|\nabla_p f|=\limsup_{x\to p}\{|\nabla_x f|\]
or equvaently $\delta_f(p)=0$.
In particular, $\delta_f(p)=0$ almost everywhere. %???ref


In this section we will use the Bochner formula (\ref{thm:bochner-formula}) to prove the following weaker version of the main theorem.
It tells that the two partial limits of strange curvature are close to each other. 

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Let $(M_n)$ be a sequence of $m$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with curvature $\ge\kappa$
that converges to an Alexandrov space $A$ without collapse.
Assume a sequence of points $p_n\in M_n$ converges to a point $p\in A$ 
and $f_n$ is a sequence of concave functions without critical points defined in $B(p_n,r)_{M_n}$ that converge to a function $f$ defined in  $B(p,r)_{A}$.
Set $u_n=\nabla f_n/|\nabla f_n|$.  

Consier the sequence of measure $\mu_n=\Str(u_n)\cdot \vol$ in $B(p_n,r)_{M_n}$.
Assume $\mu_n$ has two partial limits $\mu$ and $\nu$ on $B(p,r)_{A}$.
Then 
\[|\mu(S)-\nu(S)|
<
(\tfrac{\delta_f}{|\nabla f|}\cdot\mu)(S),\]
where $S\subset B(p,r)_{A}$ is any Borel set; we assume that $\frac{\delta_f}{|\nabla f|}=\infty$ at the points where $|\nabla f|=0$.
\end{thm}
