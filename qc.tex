\section{Convergence of direction}

Let $A$ be an Alexandrov space.
Assume $f$ is a semiconcave function defined on an open subset $\Dom f\subset A$.
For a point $p\in \Dom f$ set
\[\lip_pf=\limsup_{x\to p} \frac{|f(x)-f(p)|}{|x-p|_A}.\]
and 
\[\delta_pf=\lip_pf-|\nabla_p f|.\]

The value $\delta_pf$ measures non-linearity of the differential $d_pf$.
Since $\lip_p\zz\ge |\nabla_p f|$, we have $\delta_pf\ge 0$ for any $p$.
If $d_pf$ is linear, that is $d_pf$ as well as $-d_pf$ are concave,
then $\lip_p= |\nabla_p f|$ and hence $\delta_pf=0$.

Suppose $\xi$ is a field of directions defined on an open set $\Omega\subset A$;
that is $\xi(x)\in\Sigma_x$ for any $x\in \Omega$.
We say that $\xi$ is quasicontinuous if for any semconvex function $f$ defined in an open set $\Dom f$ and any $p\in \Dom f\cap \Omega$, we have
\[\limsup_{x\to p} d_xf(\xi_x)-\liminf_{x\to p} d_xf(\xi_x)\le \delta_pf.\] 

Assume a sequence of Riemannian manifolds $M_n$ with uniform lower curvature bound converges to an Alexandrov space $A$ of the same dimension.
Let $\xi_n$ be a sequence of fields of directions defined on an open subset $\Omega_n\subset M_n$.
We say that the sequence $\xi_n$ converges if for any sequence of $\lambda$-concave functions $f_n\:M_n\to \RR$ that converges to a (necessary $\lambda$-concave) function $f\:A\to \RR$ and any sequence of points $p_n\in \Omega_n$ that converges to a point $p\in \Omega$ we have
\[\limsup_{n\to \infty} d_{p_n}f_n(\xi_n)-\liminf_{n\to \infty} d_{p_n}f_n(\xi_n)\le \delta_p f.\]
