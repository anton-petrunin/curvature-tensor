\subsection{Locally defined Alexandrov space structure}

\begin{rdef}{Definition}
Let $A$ be a metric space. 
We say that an open  $U\subset A$
is a \emph{strongly inner domain} if
for some 
$R>0$ we have
$U\subset B(x,R)$
and $\overline{B}(x_n,10R)$ is compact.

\end{rdef}

\begin{rdef}{Definition}
We say that
 a locally compact inner metric space $A$
is an \emph{ Alexandrov region}
any point has a neighborhood where Alexandrov
comparison for curvature $\ge -1$ holds.
We say that $U\subset A$
is an \emph{ Alexandrov domain}
 if $U$ is 
 a strongly inner domain.

\end{rdef}

It is possible to show  that 
Toponogov comparison holds for sets with local structure of Alexandrov space and most of arguments and constructions for Alexandorov spaces could be applied to Alexandrov domain.
In particular we need main result from
 \cite{petrunin-SC}, where complete manifold can be replaced by 
strongly inner domain in a possibly open manifold. 
 
 
 
 Next we describe smoothing for Alexandrov domains.
 We denote by
$\M_{\ge -1}^m$ a class of $m$-dimensional Riemannian 
manifolds without boundary, but possibly non-complete, with sectional curvature bounded
from below by $-1$.

\begin{rdef}{Definition}
Let sequence
$M_n\in\M_{\ge -1}^m$ (with corresponding intrinsic metric)
converges in Gromov--Hausdorff sense to some metric space $A$.
We say that an open $U\subset A$ is \emph{good} with respect to this convergence
 if
$\dim U=m$ and for some 
$R>0$, $M_n\ni x_n\to x\in A$ we have
$U\subset B(x,R)$
and ${B(x_n,R)}$ is a strongly inner domain in
$ M_n$
. 
\end{rdef}
 Let note that in this case $B(x,10R)$ is Alexandrov region
 and $U$ is an Alexandrov domain.
 
 We will say that open $U_n\subset M_n$
approximates good subset $U$ and write $U_n\to U$
if $U_n\GHto U$ and for any $p\in U$ there is $M_n\ni p_n\to p$
and $r>0$ such that $B(p_n,r)\subset U_n$.
 
 \subsection{Rough $C^1$ structure }\label{sec:rC}
 
 
Let $f$ be a continuous semiconcave function defined on an open subset of Alexandrov space $A$.
Given $p\in \Dom f$, set 
\begin{align*}
\mathfrak{a}_f(p)&=\limsup_{x\to p}\frac{f(x)-f(p)}{|x-p|},
&
\mathfrak{b}_f(p)&=\limsup_{x\to p}\frac{f(p)-f(x)}{|p-x|}.
\end{align*}
Note that $\mathfrak{a}_f(p)=|\nabla_pf|$.



Recall that a function $f$ defined on Alexandrov space is called differentable at $p\in \Dom f$ if its differential at $p$ is a linear function;
that is, $d_pf\:\T_p\to\RR$ is concave and convex at the same time.

\begin{thm}{Claim} Let $f$ be a continuous semiconcave function defined on an open subset of Alexandrov space $A$.
Then  $f$ is differentiable at $p\in\Dom f$ if and only if $\mathfrak{a}_f(p)=\mathfrak{b}_f(p)$.
\end{thm}





\begin{thm}{Definition}
We say that a continuous semiconcave function $f$  defined
on an open subset $U$ of an Alexandrov space $A$
is \emph { roughly smooth}
and write $f\in rC^1(U)$
if 
for any compact $K\subset A$ there
is a constant $c(K)>0$, such that
$|\mathfrak{a}_f(p)-\mathfrak{b}_f(p)|< c(K)   $
for $p\in A^\delta\cap K$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:ab}
Let $A_n\to A$ be a convergence of Alexandrov spaces with uniform lower curvature bound
and $f_n$ be a sequence of continuous $\lambda$-concave functions defined on open domains in  $A_n$ that converges to a function $f$ defined on open domains in  $A$.

Then for any sequence of points $A_n\ni p_n\to p\in A$ we have
that 
\[\liminf_{n\to\infty}|\nabla_{p_n}f_n|\ge \mathfrak{a}_{f}(p)\]
and 
\[\limsup_{n\to\infty}|\nabla_{p_n}f_n|\le \mathfrak{b}_{f}(p)\]

In particular, if $f$ is differentiable at $p$, then 
\[\lim_{n\to\infty}|\nabla_{p_n}f_n|= |\nabla_{p}f|\]


and for   roughly smooth function $f$
and $p\in K$ we have
\[
\limsup_{n\to\infty}|\nabla_{p_n}f_n|-
\liminf_{n\to\infty}|\nabla_{p_n}f_n|
\le c(K)\delta. \]
 

\end{thm}




%Let    $M_n\in\M_{\ge -1}^m$,
% $M_n\GHto A$  and  $U\subset A$ be a good domain for this convergence.


 
 
 
 \subsection{Local version of the main theorem }\label{sec:loc}
 
 
\begin{thm}{Main theorem (local)}\label{mainloc}
Let   
$M_n\in\M_{\ge -1}^m$,
$M_n\GHto A$, 
  $U\subset A$ be a good domain for this convergence
  and $U_n\to U$.
  Let sequences $f_{1,n},\dots,f_{m-2,n},\\ g_{1,n},\dots,g_{m-2,n}\in C^1(U_n)$ 
 converge to
   $f_1,\dots, f_{m-2}, g_1,\dots, g_{m-2}\in rC^1(U)$ correspondingly.
Then measures 
$${q}_M(\nabla f_{1,n},\nabla f_{2,n},\dots,\nabla f_{m-2,n},
\nabla g_{1,n},\nabla g_{2,n},\dots,\nabla g_{m-2,n})\cdot\vol_m$$ weakly converges to some
measure on $U$.
\end{thm}

Theorem~\ref{main} could be reduced to the local version
in view of Lemma~\ref{testrC}.
