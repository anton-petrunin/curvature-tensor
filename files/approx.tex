\subsection{3-dimensional case}


\parit{Proof of the 3-dimensional case in \ref{prop:3parts:codim2+}.}
Suppose $M_n\smooths{}A$ and $\dim A=3$.
According to \cite{li-naber}, $A'$ is countably 1-rectifiable and $A''$ is a countable set. 

Let us split $\mathfrak m$ into negative and positive part $\mathfrak m=\mathfrak m^+-\mathfrak m^-$; that is,
\[\mathfrak m^\pm(X)\df\sup\set{\pm\mathfrak m(Y)}{Y\subset X}.\]
Since the sectional curvature of $M_n$ is bounded below, we get that $\mathfrak m^-$ has bounded density; in other words $\mathfrak m^-$ is regular measure on $A$.
Since $A'$ has vanishing volume, we get $\mathfrak m^-(A')=0$.

Set $\mathfrak n=\mathfrak m|_{A'}$; from above we have $\mathfrak n\ge 0$.
By \cite{petrunin-SC}, $\mathfrak n$ is a regular with respect to $\vol^1$ on $A'$.
Therefore it is sufficient to show that 
\[|d_ph(u)|^2\cdot (2\pi-\theta)\]
is the $\vol^1$-density of $\mathfrak n$
at $\vol^1$-almost all $p\in A'$.

Since $A'$ is countably 1-rectifiable \cite{li-naber}, we can cover it by a countable number of images of Lipschitz maps $s_i\:\mathbb{I}_i\to A$, where $\mathbb{I}_i$ is a real interval for each~$i$.
Since $s_i$ and $h\circ s_i$ are Lipschitz for any $i$, for $\vol^1$-almost all $p\in A'$ we can choose $s_i$ such that $p\in s_i(x)$ for some $x\in \mathbb{I}_i$.
By Rademacher's theorem we can assume that $s_i$ and $h\circ s_i$ are differentiable at $x$.
Moreover we can assume that $d_xs_i=\lambda\cdot u$ for some $\lambda\ne 0$ and the $\vol^1$-density of $\mathfrak n$ at $p$ is defined.

Shifting and scaling the interval $\mathbb{I}_i$, we may assume that $x=0$ and $\lambda=1$.
In this case $|d_ph(u)|=|d_0(h\circ s_i)|$.

Note that we can choose a sequence of points $p_n\in M_n$ and a sequence of factors $c_n\to \infty$ such that $(c_n\cdot M_n,p_n)$ converges to the tangent space~$\T_pA$.
Since $p\in A'$, the space $\T_p$ is a product space $\Cone(\theta)\times\RR$, where $\Cone(\theta)$ is a 2-dimensional cone with total angle $\theta(p)$.

Let $f_n\:c_n\cdot M_n\to \RR$ be as in \ref{thm:HG-converge} and $u_n=\nabla f_n/|\nabla f_n|$.
Consider the sequence of functions $\hat h_n\:c_n\cdot M_n\to \RR$ defined by 
\[\hat h_n(x)=c_n\cdot(h_n(x)-h_n(p_n)).\]
Note that $\langle\nabla \hat h_n,u_n\rangle$ uniformly converges to  $|d_0(h\circ s_i)|$.
By \ref{cor:Ricci}(\ref{cor:Ricci:vw}), the sequence of measures $\qm(\hat h_n, \hat h_n)$ on $c_n\cdot M_n\to \RR$ weakly converges to $\vol^1\otimes\kappa $ on $\T_p\zz=\Cone(\theta)\times\RR$, 
where $\kappa$ is the curvature measure of $\Cone(\theta)$; 
the measure $\kappa$ is supported at the tip $o$ of $\Cone(\theta)$
and $\kappa\{o\}=2\cdot \pi-\theta(p)$.

Observe that 
\[\qm(\hat h_n, \hat h_n)[B(p_n,1)_{c_n\cdot M_n}]
=
c_n\cdot \qm(h_n, h_n)[B(p_n,\tfrac1{c_n})_{M_n}]\]
Whence $2\cdot \pi-\theta(p)$ is the $\vol^1$-density of $\mathfrak n$ at $p$ as required.

\subsection{General case}


Suppose $M_n\smooths{} \Cone(\theta)\times \RR^{m-2}$, where $\Cone(\theta)$ denotes the two-dimensional cone with total angle $\theta<2\cdot\pi$ around the tip.
First we will show that the sectional curvatures of $M_n$ in the vertical direction of $\Cone(\theta)\times \RR^{m-2}$ weakly converge to zero;
an exact statement is given in the following proposition.

Let us denote by $K(X\wedge Y)$ the sectional curvature in the direction of $X\wedge Y$.
A function $f\:\Cone(\theta)\times\RR^{m-2}$ will be called \emph{vertical affine function} if $f$ can be obtained as a composition of the projection to $\RR^{m-2}$ and an affine function on $\RR^{m-2}$.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:vert-vert}
Let $M_n\smooths{} \Cone(\theta)\times\RR^{m-2}$
and $f_n,h_n\: M_n\to \RR$ be sequences of strongly concave functions.
Suppose that $\sec M_n\ge -\tfrac1n$ for each $n$,
and $f_n\to f$, 
$h_n\to h$ where $f$ and $h$ are vertical affine functions on $\RR^{m-2}\times \Cone(\theta)$.; that is, 
Then 
\[K(\nabla f_n\wedge\nabla h_n)\cdot\vol^m \rightharpoonup0.\]

\end{thm}

Let $\Sigma$ be a convex surface in a Riemannian manifold $M$.
Suppose $x$ is a smooth point of $\Sigma$; that is the tangent hyperplane $H_x$ of $\Sigma$ is defined at $x$;
denote by $e_1,\dots,e_{m-1}$ an orthonormal basis of $H_p$.
Set 
\[\Zc_\Sigma(x)= \sum_{i,j} K(e_i\wedge e_j)\]
where $K(e_i\wedge e_j)$ denotes the sectional curvature in the direction of $e_i\wedge e_j$.
In other words, 
\[\Zc_\Sigma=\Sc-2\cdot\Ric(n_\Sigma,n_\Sigma),\]
where $n_\Sigma$ is the unit normal vector to $\Sigma$.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:nonsmooth-convex}
Let $\Sigma$ be a strongly convex hypersurface in a Riemannian manifold with curvature $\ge -1$.
Suppose that for some point $p\in \Sigma$ and $r<1$ the closed ball $\bar B(p,2\cdot r)$ in the intrinsic metric of $\Sigma$ is compact.

Then 
\[\int_{x\in B(p,r)}\Zc_\Sigma(x)\cdot \vol^{m-1}\le (m-1)\cdot(m-2)\cdot\const(m-1)\cdot r^{m-3},\]
where $\const(m-1)$ is the constant in \ref{cor:Kmax}.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} If $\Sigma$ is smooth then the inequality follows from \ref{cor:Kmax} and the fact that sectional curvature of manifold cannot exceed sectional curvature of its convex hypersurface in the same direction.

In general case, the surface $\Sigma$ can be approximated by a smooth convex surface;
this can be done applying the Green-Wu smoothing procedure; compare to \cite{AKP-buyalo}.
It remains to pass to the limit.

\parit{Proof \ref{prop:vert-vert}.}
Let $p$ be a point on singularity of $\Cone(\theta)\times \RR^{m-2}$ and its liftings $p_n\in M_n$;
we can assume that it corresponds to the origin of $\RR^{m-2}$.
Choose points $a_{1,n},\zz\dots,a_{m-2,n}$, $b_{1,n},\zz\dots,b_{m-2,n}$ in $M_n$ such that the distance functions $f_{i,n}=\dist_{a_{i,n}}-|a_{i,n}-p|$ and $-h_{i,n}=-\dist_{b_{i,n}}+|b_{i,n}-p|$ converge to $i^{\text{th}}$ vertical coordinate function on $\Cone(\theta)\times \RR^{m-2}$.
Further, choose points $c_{1,n},\dots c_{k,n}$ so that the functions $g_{i,n}=\dist_{c_{i,n}}-|c_{i,n}-p|$ converge to Busemann functions for different horizontal rays in $\Cone(\theta)\times \RR^{m-2}$ emerging from $p$.

Observe that there is an increasing concave function $\phi$ defined in a neigbohood of zero in $\RR$ such that for any $\eps>0$ and $i\ne j$ the function 
\[s_{ij,n}=\phi\circ g_{i,n} + \phi\circ g_{j,n}+\sum_i[\phi(\tfrac{f_{i,n}}\eps)+\phi(\tfrac{h_{i,n}}\eps)]\]
is strongly concave in $B(p_n,R)$ for firxed $R>0$ and every large $n$.

Moreover given $h>0$ we can take $\eps$ small so that for all $i\ne j$ for the limit function $s_{ij}\:\Cone(\theta)\times \RR^{m-2}\to \RR$ the set $s_{ij}^{-1}[-h,h]$ coves the singular locus in $B(p,R)$. 

Note that we can choose $\eps_0>0$ so that for almost all points $x\in B(p_n,R)$ 
we can choose a functions $s_{ij,n}$ such that $d_xs_{ij,n}$ is linear and $|d_xs_{ij,n}|>\eps_0>0$.
Indeed, these differentials are linear at almost all points;
if the differential is too close to zero for $s_{ij,n}$ then, since the functions $g_{k,n}$ converge to Busemann functions for different rays, the differential of $s_{ik,n}$ cannot be too small for $k\ne j$.

Set $\Sigma_{i,n}=\Sigma_{i,n}(c)=\set{x\in M_n}{s_{i,n}(x)=c}$.
Note that \ref{lem:nonsmooth-convex} and the coarea formula we get that the sum integral curvatures of $M_n$ in the directions of $\Sigma_{i,n}$ at $x$ at the subsets where $|d_xs_i|>\eps_0$ is bounded by $\const\cdot h$ for some constant.
Since $h$ can be taken arbitrary small and at least one of the tangent directions of $\Sigma_i$ is close to the sectional direction $\nabla f_n\wedge\nabla h_n$.
Hence the statement follows.

\parit{Proof of the general case of \ref{prop:3parts:codim2+}.}
Choose a sequences of strongly concave functions $f_{1,n},\dots f_{m-2,n}\: M_n\to \RR$ that converge to vertical affine functions $f_1,\dots,f_n\to \Cone(\theta)\times \RR^{m-2}$ with orthonormal gradients.

Note that the fields $e_{1,n}=\nabla f_1,\dots,e_{m-2,n}=\nabla f_{m-2}$ are nearly orthonormal;
in particular they are linear independent for all large $n$.
Let us add two fields $e_{m-1,n}$ and $e_{m,n}$  so that $e_{1,n},\dots e_{m,n}$ form a nearly orthonormal frame in $M_n$;
that is, $\langle e_{i,n}, e_{j,n}\rangle\to 0$ for $i\ne j$ and $\langle e_{i,n}, e_{i,n}\rangle\to 1$ for any $i$ as $n\to\infty$.

Observe that \ref{prop:vert-vert} implies that $K(e_i\wedge e_j)\cdot\vol\rightharpoonup 0$ if $i,j\le m-2$.

Let us show that that $K(e_i\wedge e_j)\cdot\vol\rightharpoonup 0$ for $i\le m-2$ and $j\ge m-1$.
The $3$-dimensional case is already proved; it is used as a base of induction.
Let us apply the induction hypothesis to the level surfaces of $f_{1,n}$.
Since the curvature of convex hypersurface is larger than the curvature of the ambient manifold in the same direction we get the statement for $i\ne 1$.
Applying the same argument for the level surfaces of $f_{2,n}$, we get the result.

Now let us show that $K(e_{m-1}\wedge e_m)\cdot\vol^m\rightharpoonup \omega_{\Cone(\theta)\times \RR^{m-2}}$.
Consider the level sets $L_n$ defined by 
\[f_{1,n}=c_1,\ \dots,\ f_{m-2,n}=c_{m-2}.\eqlbl{eq:fi=ci}\]
Note that $L_n\smooths{} \Cone(\theta)$.
Applying the 2-dimensional case to $L_n$ and the coarea formula we get that curvatures of $L_n$ weakly converge to $\omega_{\Cone(\theta)\times \RR^{m-2}}$.
It remains to show that extra term in the Gauss formula for curvature of $L_n$ weakly converges to zero; 
in other words the difference between curvature of $L_n$ and sectional curvature of $M_n$ in the direction tangent to $L_n$ weakly converges to zero.

The 3-dimensional case is already proved.
To prove the general case we apply 3-dimensional case to the 3-dimensional level sets dafined by $m-3$ equations from the following $m-2$ equations in \ref{eq:fi=ci}.
(The same argument written is used in the proof of \ref{A^0} and it is written with more details.)

The same argument as in \ref{cor:Ricci} shows that $\langle\Rm(e_i,e_j)e_q,e_r\rangle\cdot\vol^m\rightharpoonup0$ is at least one of the indices $i,j,q,r$ is at most $m-2$.
The latter statement implies the result.
