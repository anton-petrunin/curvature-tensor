\section{Singularities of codimension 3}\label{sec:codmi=3}


\parit{Proof of \ref{prop:3parts}(\ref{prop:3parts:codim3}).}
According to \cite[10.6]{BGP}, $A''$ has vanishing $(m-2)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure;
that is, $A''$ can be covered by a countable family of balls $B(x_i,r_i)$ such that $\sum r_i^{m-2}$ is arbitrary small.
Therefore \ref{cor:Kmax} and Corollary~\ref{cor:Kmax} imply the statement.
