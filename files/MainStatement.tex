\begin{thm}{Main theorem}\label{main}
Let $M_n\smooths{} A$ be a smoothing of Alexandrov space $A$.
Then $\mathfrak{q}_n\rightharpoonup \mathfrak{q}$, where $\mathfrak{q}_n$ denoted the dual measure-valued curvature tensor of $M_n$
and $\mathfrak{q}$ is some for some measure-valued tensor on $A$.
\end{thm}

By Perelman's stability theorem $A$ is a topological manifold.
In particular, $A$ has no boundary.
Therefore the theorem follows from the following more exact formulation.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:3parts}
Let $M_n$ be a sequence of $3$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds such that $M_n\zz\to A$ without collapsing.
Suppose $h_n\:M_n\to\RR$ be a sequence of $\lambda$-concave $L$-Lipscitz smooth functions that converges to a function $h\:A\to R$.
Let $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ be a weak partial limits of the sequence of measures $q_{M_n}(\nabla h_n,\nabla h_n)$ on $A$.
Then the following statements hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{prop:3parts:codim3} Measures $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ vanish on $A''$; that is, 
\[\mu_i|_{A''}=0\]
for $i=1,2$.
\item\label{prop:3parts:codim2} Measures $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ satisfy the following equation:
\[\mu_i|_{A'}=\omega\cdot |dh(u)|^2\]
for $i=1,2$.
where $u=u(p)$ is a choice of vertical unit vectors at any point $p\in A'$;
\item For any $\delta>0$, measures $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ approximately coinside on $A^\delta$;
namely, for any bounded set $\Omega\subset A$ there is a constant $\const$ such that 
\[(\mu_1-\mu_2)(\Omega\cap A^\delta)\le \const\cdot \delta.\]
In particular, we have
\[\mu_1|_{A^\circ}=\mu_2|_{A^\circ}.\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

Each part of the proposition will be proved separately.
