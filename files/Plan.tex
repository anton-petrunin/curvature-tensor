\subsection{Common chart and delta-convergence}

Choose a smoothing $M_n\smooths{} A$ of an $m$-dimensional Alexandrov space $A$.
Let $p\in A$ be a point of rank $m$; that is, there are $m+1$ points $a_0,\dots, a_m\in A$ such that 
$\angk p{a_i}{a_j}>\tfrac\pi2$ for all $i\ne j$.

Recall that we can choose a small $r>0$ and finite set of points $A_i$ near $a_i$ and a smooth concave increasing real-to-real function $\phi$ defined on an open interval such that the function
\[f_i=\sum_{x\in A_i}\phi\circ\widetilde{\dist}_{a_i,r}\]
is defined in a neighborhood $U\ni p$ and strongly concave.

Since $r$ is small and $A_i$ is near $a_i$ we get that the functions $f_0, \dots, f_m$ are tight in $U$; see the definition in \cite{petrunin-conc}.
In particular, the map $U\to\RR^m$ defined by $x\mapsto (f_1(x),\dots,f_m(x))$ is a coordinate system in $U$.

The presented construction can be naturally lifted to $M_n$.
As a result we obtain a chart of an open set $U_n\subset M_n$.
Passing to smaller sets we may assume that $U$ and each $U_n$ is mapped to a fixed open set $\Omega\subset\RR^m$ for all large $n$.
Further we assume that it holds for all $n$; it could be achieved by cutting off the beginning of the sequence $M_n$.

The obtained collection charts $U_n\to \Omega$ and $U\to \Omega$ will be called \emph{common chart} at $p$.
It will be used to identify points of $\Omega$, $M_n$ and $A$; 
in addition we will use it to identify the tangent spaces $\T M_n$ and $\T A$ with $\RR^m$.
For example, we will use the same notation for function $M_n\to \RR$ and its composition $\Omega\to \RR$ with the inverse of the chart $U_n\to \Omega$.
We will use index $n$ or skip it to indicate that the calculations are performed in $M_n$ or $A$ respectively.
For example, given a function $f\:\Omega\to \RR$, we denote by $\nabla_nf$ the gradient of the function $f\circ \bm{x}$ in $M_n$.

Recall that $A^\delta$ denotes the set of $\delta$-strained points in $A$.
For a fixed common chart $\bm{x}$ we will use notation $A^\delta=A^\delta_\Omega$ also for the image $\bm{x}(A^\delta)$.

The part \ref{prop:3parts}(\ref{prop:3parts:reg}) will be reduced to certain estimates in one common chart that

\begin{thm}{Definitions}\label{def:delta-converge}
Let $M_n\smooths{} A$, $\dim A=m$;
choose a common chart with range $\Omega\subset \RR^m$.

A sequence of measures $(\mathfrak n_n)$ defined on $\Omega$ is called \emph{weakly delta-converging}
if the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Every subsequence of $(\mathfrak n_n)$ has a weak partial limit.
 \item For any $\eps>0$ there is $\delta>0$ such that for any two weak partial limits $\mathfrak m_1$ and $\mathfrak m_2$ of $(\mathfrak n_n)$ we have  
\[|(\mathfrak m_1-\mathfrak m_2)(S)|<\eps\]
for any Borel set $S\subset \Omega\cap A^\delta$.
\end{enumerate}

A sequence of functions $f_n$ defined on $\Omega$ is called \emph{uniformly delta-converging}
if the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Every subsequence of $f_n$ has a partial uniform limit.
 \item For any $\eps>0$ there is $\delta>0$ such that for any two uniform partial limits $h_1$ and $h_2$ of $f_n$  such that 
\[|h_1(x)-h_2(x)|<  \eps\]
for any $x\in \Omega\cap A^\delta$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Observation}\label{obs:delta-weak-uniform}
If $f_n$ is uniformly delta-converging and $\mathfrak n_n$ is weakly delta-converging,
then $f_n\cdot \mathfrak n_n$ is weakly delta-converging.
\end{thm}





The following proposition lists the properties of the common charts.

\begin{thm}{ Proposition}\label{Prop:chart}
Let $M_n\smooths{} A$, $\dim A=m$, and
$\bm{x}\: U_n\zz\to \Omega$ and $\bm{x}\: U\zz\to \Omega$ is a common chart.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

%\addtocounter{enumi}{2}
\item\label{obtuse}
The coordinates functions $x_i$ are tight concave function in $M_n$ and $A$;
in addition, $x_i$ smooth in $M_n$.

\item The charts are bi-Lipschitz  with uniform  bi-Lipschitz 
constants.

\item\label{metric} 
Denote by $S_\Omega$ the image of singular locus of $A$ in $\Omega$.
There exists a continuous Riemannian metric
$g$ on $\Omega\setminus S_\Omega$ which locally 
realizes distance on $A$.
Moreover, $g$ has bounded variation
on $\Omega$. 

\item\label{metricseq}
$(g_{ij,n}, g_{ij})\in BV_0^{seq}(\Omega, S_\Omega)$, where $g_n$ is the metric tensor of $M_n$ on $\Omega$.
Moreover, $\det(g_n)$ is bounded and bounded away from 0.


\item\label{funktioninchart}
For any
sequence
of concave smooth functions
$f_n:B(p_n,r_n)\to\R$ 
which roughly $C^1$-converges to  $f:B(p,r)\to\R$ we have for its coordinate
expression
$(f_n\circ\bm{x}^{-1}, f\circ\bm{x}^{-1})\in DC_0^{seq}(\Omega, S_\Omega)$

\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\subsection{Test convergence}

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:test-delta}
Let $M_n\smooths{} A$, $\dim A=m$;
choose a common chart with range $\Omega\subset \RR^m$.
Let $f_n\: M_n\to\RR$ be a sequence of test function such that $f_n\testto f\:A\to \RR$.
Then 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item\label{lem:test-delta-f} $f_n$ uniformly converges to $f$ on $\Omega$
\item\label{lem:test-delta|nabla|} $|\nabla f_n|$ uniformly delta-converges on $\Omega$
\item\label{lem:test-delta-partial} $\partial_if_n$ are delta-converging to the corresponding components of $\partial_i f$ in $\Omega$;
here $\partial_1,\dots,\partial_m$ denote the partial derivatives on $\Omega\subset \RR^m$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} Part (\ref{lem:test-delta-f}) is trivial; let us show part (\ref{lem:test-delta-partial}).

Note that for any point $p\in A$ and almost all points $y,z\in A$ the following holds:
for any sequence of points $p_n,y_n,z_n\in M_n$ such that $p_n$, $y_n$, and $z_n$ converge to $p$, $y$, and $z$ respectively we have
\[\measuredangle \hinge{p_n}{y_n}{z_n}\to \measuredangle \hinge{p}{y}{z}.\]

Note that if $\T_p$ is Euclidean, then the latter implies that 
\[\langle d_p\widetilde\dist_{y_n,r},d_p\widetilde\dist_{z_n,r}\rangle\to \langle d_p\widetilde\dist_{y,r},d_p\widetilde\dist_{z,r}\rangle\]
for \emph{any} choice of sequences $p_n$, $y_n$, and $z_n$ that converge to $p$, $y$, and $z$ respectively.
The later implies that 
\[\langle d_pf_n,d_ph_n\rangle\to \langle d_pf,d_ph\rangle\]
if $f_n,h_n\:M_n\to\RR$ are sequences of test functions such that $f_n\testto f$ and $h_n\testto h$.

Note that the partial derivatives $\partial_if_n$ at a regular point $p$ can be expressed in terms of $\langle d_pf_n,d_px_j\rangle_n$ and $\langle d_px_j,d_px_k\rangle_n$, where $x_1,\dots,x_m$ are the coordinate functions of the chart.
Therefore we get that $\partial_if_n$ converge at any regular point.

Finally observe that if $p$ is a $\delta$-strained point for sufficiently small $\delta>0$,
then the calculations above go thru with a small error.
Whence the statement follows.

\parit{(\ref{lem:test-delta|nabla|}).}
Note that $|\nabla f_n|$ can be expressed from $\langle d_px_j,d_px_k\rangle_n$ and $\partial_if_n$.
Since these quantities delta-converging so is $|\nabla f_n|$.

\subsection{Key lemma}

The proof of the following statement will take the remaining part of Section \ref{sec:ref}.
Here we will show that \ref{prop:3parts}(\ref{prop:3parts:reg}) follows from this lemma.

\begin{thm}{Key lemma}\label{A^0}
Choose a common chart of a smoothing $M_n\smooths{} A$.
Suppose that $\Omega\subset \RR^m$ is the range of the common chart.
Choose a component $\Rm_{ijsr,n}$ the curvature tensor of $M_n$ in $\Omega$.
Then $\Rm_{ijsr,n}\cdot \vol^m_n$ is a weakly delta-converging sequence of measures.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof of \ref{prop:3parts}(\ref{prop:3parts:reg}) modulo \ref{lem:test-delta} and \ref{A^0}.}
Recalled that components of $\qm_n$ can be expressed from the components of $\Rm_n$.
Therefore the key lemma implies delta-convergence of components of $\qm_n$.

Choose sequences of test functions $f_{1,n},\dots,f_{m-2,n},h_{1,n},\zz\dots,h_{m-2,n}$ on $M_n$ that test-converge to $f_{1},\dots,f_{m-2},h_{1},\dots,h_{m-2}\:A\to \RR$.
By \ref{lem:test-delta}, we have delta-convergence of the partial derivatives $\partial_if_{j,n}$ and 
$\partial_ih_{j,n}$ to $\partial_if_{j}$ and 
$\partial_ih_{j}$ respectively.
The measures $\qm_n(f_{1,n},\dots,f_{m-2,n},h_{1,n},\zz\dots,h_{m-2,n})$ 
as a linear combination of the components of $\qm_n$ with coefficients that expressed in terms of $\partial_if_{j,n}$.
By \ref{obs:delta-weak-uniform}, it follows that the sequence of measures 
\[\mathfrak m_n=\qm_n(f_{1,n},\dots,f_{m-2,n},h_{1,n},\zz\dots,h_{m-2,n})\]
is delta-converging.

Finally recall that 
\[A^\circ=\bigcap_{\delta>0}A^\delta.\]
Therefore delta-convergence of $\qm_n(f_{1,n},\dots,f_{m-2,n},h_{1,n},\zz\dots,h_{m-2,n})$ implies \ref{prop:3parts}(\ref{prop:3parts:reg}).
