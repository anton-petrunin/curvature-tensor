Let $S$ be a convex surface in a three-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$.
Denote by $\nu$ the normal vector to $S$ in the outward direction.
Assume $f$ is a function defined in a neigborhood of $S$ such that 
$\langle \nabla f,\nu\rangle$
\end{thm}



\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Let $M$ be a 3-dimensional manifold with sectional curvature at least $\kappa$ and $L$ be a smooth convex surface in $M$ with boundary, denote by $n$ the field of unit normal vectors on $L$ that points outside of the convex region that $L$ cuts from $M$.
Assume there is a smooth concave function $f$ such that $f$ vanish at the boundary $\partial L$,
the gradient $\<\nabla f,n\>\ge 1$ at any point of $L$.
Then the integral of Gauss curvature on $L$ does not exceed???
\end{thm}

We will need an other integral reformation of Bochner's identity.

\begin{thm}{Bound on determinant of Hessian}
Let $g$ be a Riemannian metric with nonnegative curvature on the 2-dimensional disc $\DD$.
Assume $f\:\DD\zz\to \RR$ is a smooth concave function that vanish on the boundary $\partial \DD$.
Then 
\[\int_\DD \det(\Hess f)\le \pi\cdot \sup\{|\nabla f|\}. \]
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
By relative Bochner's formula, we have
\[\int_\DD(\Delta f)^2-|\Hess f|^2-K\cdot |\nabla f|^2=\int_{\partial\DD} \kappa\cdot |\nabla f|^2,\]
where $K$ denotes the curvature of $g$ and $\kappa$ --- geodesic curvature of $\partial\DD$.

If $\lambda_1\le \lambda_2$ denote the eigenvalues of $\Hess f$,
then 
\[\Delta f=\lambda_1+\lambda_2\quad\text{and}\quad |\Hess f|^2=\lambda_1^2+\lambda_2^2;\]
Therefore 
\begin{align*}
(\Delta f)^2-|\Hess f|^2&=2\cdot\lambda_1\cdot \lambda_2=
\\
&=2\cdot\det(\Hess f).
\end{align*}

Since $f$ is concave and vanish on $\partial\DD$, the disc $\DD$ has convex boundary, that is, $\kappa\ge 0$.
Further, from by Gauss--Bonnet formula, we get that
\[\int_\DD K+\int_{\partial\DD} \kappa =2\cdot \pi.\]
Whence, 
\begin{align*}
\int_\DD 2\cdot(\det\Hess f)
&=
\int_\DD K\cdot |\nabla f|^2
+
\int_{\partial\DD} \kappa\cdot |\nabla f|^2\le 
\\
&\le 2\cdot \pi \cdot \sup\{\,|\nabla_x f|^2\,\},
\end{align*}
hence the result.
